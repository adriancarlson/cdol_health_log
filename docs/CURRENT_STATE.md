# Current State

## Repository and plugin rename (26.9.7.62)

The repository is `adriancarlson/cdol_health`. The application plugin is now
`CDOL Health`, and the generated permissions plugin is `CDOL Health - Data Access`.
Both packages use version 26.9.7.62. The local checkout is named `cdol_health`.

This is a packaging and repository rename. Existing schema/table names, page
catalog IDs, feature labels, asset paths, and page URLs remain unchanged for
compatibility. Earlier release notes retain their historical plugin names.
PowerSchool installation and acceptance of the renamed plugins remain unverified.

## Shared CSS extraction (26.9.7.61)

CDOL CSS 26.9.0.3 owns Health Log presentation in the dedicated `CDOL Health Log`
section of `web_root/images/css/cdol.css`. Health History, Medical Authorization,
medication inventory/administration, their drawers, Health Log drawers/lists, and
district Health Code Sets no longer ship embedded or inline CSS. The former
`healthForms.css` file is removed. Shared alignment, alert-heading, width, and
padding classes are reused; feature rules are scoped to their pages or drawer
form IDs. The chart uses a named print page to keep landscape settings local.

Install CDOL CSS 26.9.0.3 before the matching Health Log 26.9.7.61 application and
Data Access packages. Refresh cached styles after updating. Installed PowerSchool
screen, drawer, responsive, and print validation remains pending.

Local validation: 48 page/drawer, viewport, and media comparisons retain the
previous computed styles; all 349 new CSS rules are scoped. Existing shared CSS
is preserved, and unrelated-selector checks pass. The fictional chart prints to
one US Letter landscape page. Health form and optimization browser suites, 16
medication/chart tests, XML/JSON parsing, JavaScript syntax, and diff checks pass.

## Health form request and rendering improvements (26.9.7.60)

Attachment sections share district-category requests for up to 60 seconds. Each
section can reuse its discovery result once when opened within 30 seconds;
student/category/visibility changes clear that result. Refresh documents bypasses
both caches. Document content still requires a fresh authorized request, and
failed category requests remain retryable.

The secured medicationDoseUnits.json endpoint filters MED_DOSE_UNIT options on
the server, excludes disabled/blank-code rows, and returns only code, label, and
display order in one request. Null visibility retains the previous behavior.
The client retains sorting, code deduplication, empty-state handling, and legacy
label support; unit labels now use an index instead of repeated array scans.

Both forms stop change detection at the first changed eligible field. Prescription
Add/Edit rows share one control template, and redundant action-plan child
visibility checks were removed. Save verification, audit checks, conditional
field preservation, and the alert text-box styling are retained.

Local AngularJS tests cover request sharing/expiry/refresh, context isolation,
malformed responses, more than 100 dose units, form submissions, prescription
CRUD, and audit retries. Installed Oracle endpoint/permission validation and live
performance measurement remain pending.

## Allergy Alert text area (26.9.7.59)

The Allergy Alert field uses the same six-row, 80-column text area and
standardalerts styling as the Medical Alert and other alert text boxes. It
retains the StudentCoreFields.allergies binding and existing form submission and
audit behavior. Installed PowerSchool visual and save validation remain pending.

## Prescription confirmation placement and card padding (26.9.7.57)

Green prescription save confirmations now appear inside the medication card,
above Add Medication. Error messages and the audit retry remain outside the
conditional card so they stay accessible if the medication answer is No or blank.
The card has only 10px of right padding; top, bottom, and left padding are zero.
Installed visual validation remains pending.

## Prescription default and layout corrections (26.9.7.56)

Prescription return options now use Return to school office, with the shorter
Return to school option removed. The medication instructions sit above the card;
only the Add Medication button and table remain inside it.

On form load, the saved STUDENT_MEDICATION answer is the default. After both
authorization and prescription loads complete, existing rows belonging to the
selected student promote the answer to Yes. Empty, failed, or other-student lists
do not promote it. The original saved value remains the change-tracking baseline,
so the correction becomes a pending change saved by normal Submit, with audit and
read-back verification. It is applied once per form load, preserving subsequent
administrator edits and avoiding any automatic database write or record deletion.
Tests cover both response arrival orders, blank/No/Yes defaults, rows/no rows,
failed loads, ownership, visibility, and saving the correction. Installed
PowerSchool validation remains pending.

## OTC attachment category correction (26.9.7.55)

The OTC authorization document picker now uses the corrected category
Non-Prescription. Tests and documentation use the same spelling. The saved
NON_RX_COLLECTION_METHOD field and attachment behavior are unchanged.

## Prescription authorization documents and medication card (26.9.7.54)

Prescription Medications now groups its medication instructions, Add Medication
button, and editable table in a bordered card. The approved Prescription
Authorization Form instructions appear below, with the linked diocesan form,
pale deadline highlight, and italic prescription-requirement condition.

RX_COLLECTION_METHOD supplies read-only tags for Upload, Return to school, and
Student does not require prescription medication to be administered at school.
The shared directive accepts custom options; other forms retain their existing
choices. The authorization block stays visible when the medication card is hidden
so the parent's not-required answer remains accessible. The Prescription category
uses the existing Upload-or-matching-document icon, authorized preview, and native
Attachments fallback. Return-method values are excluded from API writes.

Tests cover card placement, approved wording/link, all three tags, category
isolation, permissions, previews, cleanup, no document-induced writes, and existing
medication editing/saving. Installed layout and field/category validation remain
pending.

## OTC document section break and approved wording (26.9.7.53)

The document block below the OTC medication grid now has a thin divider, extra
spacing, and an OTC Authorization Form subheading. The instructions use the
approved two-sentence paragraph, retaining the linked form title and pale deadline
highlight. The repeated annual-requirement sentence is removed. Saved return
methods and document access are unchanged.

## OTC authorization form links (26.9.7.52)

Both mentions in the OTC document instructions now read "Over-the-Counter (OTC)
Medication Authorization Form" and link to the supplied SharePoint form in a new
tab. Return-method and document-preview behavior are unchanged.

## OTC authorization document capture (26.9.7.51)

Medical Authorization now displays the personalized OTC authorization instructions
directly below the OTC medication grid. The annual requirement starts on a new
line, with the shared pale-yellow first-week deadline. NON_RX_COLLECTION_METHOD
supplies the read-only Parent/Guardian return-method tags through a native page
token; it is not added to the authorization API save payload.

The shared document picker uses the exact supplied category Non-Prescription.
Upload or matching active metadata shows the icon, with existing permission,
preview, and native Attachments fallback behavior. Discovery is enabled once
the authorization form has loaded. Tests cover placement, wording, saved choice,
icon conditions, category filtering, preview cleanup, and absence of form writes.
Installed field/category and visual validation remain pending.

## Health History submit scrolling (26.9.7.50)

Health History now uses the same 600 ms smooth scroll as Medical Authorization,
resetting both PowerSchool's content-main panel and the browser window. A valid,
changed submit starts scrolling without intercepting or delaying the native POST.
On the returned page, the existing changesSaved parameter also triggers scrolling
after page load so the native confirmation is visible after scroll restoration.
Ordinary loads and blocked/unchanged submits do not trigger scrolling.

Both controllers share the scroll helper and cancel pending animation/timers when
destroyed. Browser tests cover intermediate scroll positions, the saved-page
controller initialization, no-change behavior, and unchanged native submission.
Installed PowerSchool navigation/scroll restoration validation remains pending.

## Remove Extended Care and empty state section (26.9.7.49)

Health History no longer includes Extended Care or the state emergency include
box beneath it. Sports Participation is now the last section before Submit.
The removed controls no longer participate in this page's submission; stored
values are unchanged. Installed visual validation remains pending.

## School 104 Dental Examination documents (26.9.7.48)

The school 104 Dental Examination block now uses personalized annual-submission
instructions, the supplied SharePoint report link, and the same pale deadline
highlight as Meal Accommodation. Parent/Guardian wording is retained. The saved
DENTAL_PLAN_COLLECTION_METHOD uses read-only tags with a descriptive label.
The shared attachment picker uses category Dental and is enabled only at current
SchoolID 104. Upload or a matching active document shows the icon; permissions,
preview, and native Attachments fallback follow the existing action-plan behavior.
Tests cover saved-method visibility, category isolation, download permission,
preview, and cleanup when leaving school 104. Installed validation remains pending.

## Parent/Guardian wording (26.9.7.47)

Health History and Medical Authorization now consistently use Parent/Guardian
in visible instructions, consent labels, signatures, and return-method labels,
including the shared return-method accessibility label. Singular verbs match the
requested wording. Field names, bindings, and submission behavior are unchanged.

## Dental section (26.9.7.46)

Dental now appears immediately above Health Alerts for current Students.SchoolID
120 or 104. School 120 shows a Dental Agreement heading and the DENTAL_AGREE
checkbox, styled like Medical Agreements, with the requested personalized
parent/guardian confirmation. School 104 retains its Dental Examination
instructions and read-only parent return method within the same section.
The previous standalone dental sections are removed. Both dental conditions now
use current SchoolID rather than the enrollment workflow school.

Conditional native checkbox companions are disabled with their checkbox so
PowerSchool's generated unchecked-value input cannot clear a hidden agreement.
Tests cover school visibility, section order, checked/unchecked values, native
submission exclusion, and saved-value preservation. Installed validation remains
pending.

## Meal Accommodation section (26.9.7.45)

Meal Accommodation now appears immediately below Action Plan as a separate section
when the student's current SchoolID is 130 or 131 and ALLERGY_AGREE is 1. It uses
the requested personalized wording and SharePoint form link, with a pale-yellow
deadline, and displays FOOD_PLAN_COLLECTION_METHOD using the shared read-only tags.
Its document icon links directly to the selected student's Attachments page in a
new tab for every saved method; no category lookup or document preview is used.
The previous meal section and separate instructions condition are replaced.
Tests cover current-school versus enrollment-school differences, both allowed
schools, school 110 exclusion, allergy No, section order, and direct navigation.
Installed PowerSchool validation remains pending.

## Action Plan instruction line breaks (26.9.7.44)

The Diabetes, Seizure, and Asthma/Severe Allergy instructions each start
"An updated plan" on a new line. Wording and conditional behavior are unchanged.

## Fixed contact column widths (26.9.7.43)

Health Contacts keeps its three equal desktop columns at every school. Physician
and Dentist each occupy one third; Daycare appears in the third column only for
school 110 (St. Peter's). Elsewhere that space stays blank, and the existing Daycare
DOM/values remain preserved with fields hidden and excluded from submission.
The two-column expansion override is removed. Mobile stacking is retained.

## Medical History question grouping (26.9.7.42)

Asthma/anaphylaxis and inhaler questions share the second row, with no third
question. Allergies/dietary restrictions and EpiPen share the third row, also with
no third question. The first row retains glasses, diabetes, and seizures. Existing
values and conditional rules are unchanged. Joined-card outer corners follow the
new desktop arrangement and retain the question order in the mobile stack.

## Shared Asthma/Severe Allergy Action Plan (26.9.7.41)

Action Plan now includes one Asthma/Severe Allergy block when INHALER or EPIPEN
is Yes, including when both are Yes. ASTHMA alone does not show it. Personalized
wording uses the student's name throughout, an underlined provider-form phrase,
May 1 with superscript st, and the pale-yellow deadline. The existing
ALLERGY_PLAN_COLLECTION_METHOD supplies its read-only return-method tags.

The icon appears for Upload or matching Allergy/Asthma attachments. The shared
picker resolves both category names, uses the native multi-category filter, checks
either category on returned metadata, and deduplicates document IDs. Existing
permissions, previews, and fallback apply. The old standalone Asthma/Allergy plan
section is removed. Local tests cover each trigger, both together, neither,
category union, duplicates, icon conditions, and previews. Installed multi-category
filtering and visual verification remain pending.

## Seizure return-method label (26.9.7.40)

The seizure label now reads "Parent's Stated Return Method for Seizure Action Plan."
The saved choice, styling, and attachment behavior remain unchanged.

## Unselected return-method options (26.9.7.39)

All return-method displays retain the saved choice as a text tag and show the
unselected standard options beside it in smaller, muted, borderless text. Blank
or historical values retain their tag and show both standard options. Everything
remains read-only, with no form inputs or changes to attachment behavior.

## Read-only return badges and date styling (26.9.7.38)

All parent return methods now display one high-contrast text badge containing the
saved choice, or Not recorded for a blank value. Disabled radios are removed; the
display still cannot submit or edit the parent answer. Both May 1 references use
`May 1<sup>st</sup>`, and Action Plan deadlines use pale yellow `#fff2cc` instead
of bright yellow. Existing icon conditions and preview permissions are retained.
The rendered-field Angular suite passed, and the local layout was inspected with
synthetic data. Installed PowerSchool visual validation remains pending.

## Attachment presence also shows plan icons (26.9.7.37)

For each applicable Diabetes or Seizure plan, show the document icon when the saved
return method is Upload OR the native metadata response contains an active document
in that plan's category. Non-Upload methods trigger metadata discovery automatically;
no file content is loaded until selection. Matching metadata can show an icon even
if download permission is absent, but the picker still excludes files that cannot
be previewed by the current account. Lookup failures retain a native Attachments
link and a status message. Context changes discard stale lookup results. Parent
choices and submitted fields are unchanged. Local tests pass for both categories,
including blank/office/historical choices, no matches, denied access, and failures.
Installed PowerSchool validation remains pending.

## Diabetes return-method label (26.9.7.36)

The diabetes label now reads "Parent's Stated Return Method for Diabetes Medical
Management Plan (DMMP)." The stored field, display behavior, and other labels are
unchanged.

## Seizure Action Plan integration (26.9.7.35)

When SEIZURE_AGREE is Yes, Action Plan shows personalized Seizure Action Plan
instructions at every school, with the provider-form phrase underlined and the
deadline highlighted. The saved SEIZURE_PLAN_COLLECTION_METHOD displays once as
read-only radios. Upload enables the shared picker/preview for category Seizure.
Diabetes and seizure blocks appear independently and both display when applicable.
The old school-limited Seizure Action Plan section and logic are removed.
Local Angular tests cover the combined/separate conditions, category isolation,
seizure preview, and cleanup when seizures changes to No. Installed verification
of the Seizure category and documents remains pending.

## Personalized provider form wording (26.9.7.34)

Action Plan now says `using ~(first_name)'s health care provider’s form`, with
the student's name and provider-form phrase underlined as before.

## Restricted activities example styling (26.9.7.33)

The `ie. Physical Education` subtext now uses the shared OTC example style, with
the same inherited text size and three-pixel bottom spacing. Its question label
aligns with the example and textarea, with the same three-pixel gap as the OTC
question headings. Wording, field mapping, and visibility are unchanged.
Installed visual validation remains pending.

## Action Plan replaces Diabetes Documentation (26.9.7.32)

The duplicate Diabetes Documentation section and its school-specific visibility
and document-link rules are removed. Action Plan handles the diabetes instructions,
saved parent return method, and attachment picker at every school. Its existing
Diabetes/seizure visibility rules remain in place.

## Standalone Action Plan section (26.9.7.31)

Action Plan is now a separate section immediately after Medical History, using
the same box, banner, and content styling as Health Contacts and Health Alerts.
The blue feedback alert styling is removed. Existing conditional visibility,
wording, highlighted deadline, saved parent choice, and document picker/preview
behavior are retained. Installed visual validation remains pending.

## Action Plan document preview (26.9.7.30)

When the saved diabetes return choice is Upload, the document icon loads the
selected student's active, downloadable Diabetes attachments. An inline picker
shows filenames and native upload dates; choosing a file previews a PDF or common
image without submitting the Health History form. The native Attachments link
remains available for missing files, denied access, unsupported types, and errors.
Category IDs are resolved by name, results are paginated, and Blob URLs are released
on close or context changes. New parent uploads are expected to use Diabetes;
historical categories are not changed. Local validation is documented in
`HEALTH_ACTION_PLAN_ATTACHMENTS.md`; installed Health History validation remains
pending. No new permissions or production record changes are included.

## Action Plan attachment link (26.9.7.29)

Diabetes return method Upload shows the copied document-alert icon and an Open
student attachments link beneath the parent choice. It opens the selected student's
native Attachments page in a new tab, with guidance to look for category Diabetes.
The supplied preview fragment cannot independently resolve a permitted Diabetes
document from Health History, so this uses the user-authorized navigation fallback.
Plugin analysis and installed validation requirements are documented in
`HEALTH_ACTION_PLAN_ATTACHMENTS.md`.

## Action Plan parent return method (26.9.7.28)

The inline Action Plan notice shows the parent's saved diabetes submission method
below the instructions whenever Diabetes is Yes, including school 101. The existing
display moves here from Diabetes Documentation. Disabled Upload / Return to school
office radios show the saved value; blank values show Not recorded. The display
cannot overwrite the parent's choice and is hidden for seizure-only cases.
Installed PowerSchool validation remains pending.

## Action Plan notice instructions (26.9.7.27)

The existing inline Action Plan notice shows the approved DMMP instructions when
Diabetes is Yes, including school 101. The text identifies the student and school,
underlines the provider's form phrase, and highlights the first-week-of-school
deadline. The title stays Action Plan; seizure-only cases keep the general wording.
The separate Diabetes Documentation section and its existing rules remain unchanged.
Installed PowerSchool validation remains pending.

## School-specific daycare card (26.9.7.24)

The Daycare Provider card and phone show only for enrollment school 110. Other
schools show two joined provider cards. Hidden daycare fields are excluded from
submission and change tracking, preserving existing values.
Installed PowerSchool validation remains pending.

## Joined Health Contacts cards (26.9.7.23)

The Physician, Dentist, and Daycare Provider cards touch, using single shared
borders and rounded outer corners in both desktop and stacked mobile layouts.
Installed PowerSchool visual validation remains pending.

## Native Health History Submit button (26.9.7.22)

The bottom Health History Submit button now uses PowerSchool's native styling.
Custom padding, corner radius, and disabled opacity/cursor overrides are removed.
The existing Angular enable/disable and submit behavior is retained.
Installed PowerSchool visual validation remains pending.

## Full-width question grids (26.9.7.21)

The OTC and Medical History question tables fill the available content width and
align left. Card styling and the narrow-screen stacked layout are retained.
Installed PowerSchool visual validation remains pending.

## Health Contacts cards (26.9.7.20)

Physician, Dentist, and Daycare Provider each have a separate card containing the
provider and phone fields. The cards match OTC colors, borders, padding, rounded
corners, and focus styling. They retain the existing three-column layout and stack
on narrow screens. Field bindings and required physician fields are unchanged.
Installed PowerSchool visual validation remains pending.

## Medical History question styling (26.9.7.19)

The seven Medical History Yes/No questions share the OTC medication section's
compact shaded cells, borders, rounded corners, and responsive three-column layout.
Both pages use the same CSS. Existing bindings and submission remain unchanged.
Installed PowerSchool visual validation remains pending.

## Health History emergency authorization removal (26.9.7.18)

The Emergency Authorization section and its physician consent, hospital treatment
preference, and preferred hospital questions are removed from Health History.
Existing saved values remain unchanged. Installed PowerSchool validation is pending.

## Health History alerts (26.9.7.17)

Health Alerts now appears immediately above Sports Participation. Allergy Alert,
Medical Alert, Medical Action Plan Alert, and Concussion Alert retain the native
Alerts page tables, headings, and icon paths. The single allergy input moves into
this section. All seven alert fields use Health History's existing Angular model,
change tracking, native submission, and medical audit stamp. The action-plan and
concussion flags use checked `1` / unchecked `0`.

Both packages are built. AngularJS browser tests passed with source and simulated
PowerSchool field names, including alert initialization, reverts, and submission.
XML, package-content, and diff checks passed. Installed field rendering, checkbox
clearing, heading toggles, icons, and persistence still require PowerSchool validation.

## Faster scroll and borderless prescription question (26.9.7.13)

The smooth post-submit scroll now takes 600ms. The STUDENT_MEDICATION Yes/No
question has no border or shaded background. Both 26.9.7.13 packages are built;
installed visual validation remains pending.

## Medical section wrapper cleanup (26.9.7.12)

Read-only inspection identified a native white fieldset background and a gray
inner wrapper with added margin and padding. The medical fieldset and section
wrapper now have transparent backgrounds, with the inner wrapper spacing removed.
Individual section boxes retain their backgrounds and spacing. Both 26.9.7.12
packages are built; installed visual validation remains pending.

## Gradual scroll and prescription text layout (26.9.7.11)

Verified submits ease the content panel and window to the top over one second
after the loading dialog closes. The animation is canceled when the controller
is destroyed. Browser tests verify intermediate scroll positions. The prescription
Yes/No question no longer has a shaded background, and the Add Medication
instruction starts on a new line. Both 26.9.7.11 packages are built; installed
visual validation remains pending.

## Prescription requirement and bottom Submit (26.9.7.10)

The prescription Yes/No question uses U_STUDENT_ADDITIONAL_INFO.STUDENT_MEDICATION.
The parent form mapping and installed Health History validation metadata confirm
Yes=1/No=0 and a Boolean field. JSON loading and verified schema API saves include
this field. Blank/No hides the instructions, Add Medication, and table; Yes shows
them. No preserves medication records. The question is disabled during medication
edits/audit retries. Add Medication is above the table and the main Submit follows
the signature section. Prescription row saves remain independent.

Browser tests cover visibility, Boolean saves, record preservation, audit isolation,
button placement, CRUD, and post-submit scrolling. Both 26.9.7.10 packages are built;
installed JSON execution and save validation remain pending.

## Rounded OTC outer corners (26.9.7.9)

The compact, joined OTC cards now have 10px rounded outer corners on desktop
and narrow screens. Internal borders stay joined. Both 26.9.7.9 packages are
built; installed visual validation remains pending.

## Compact OTC question cards (26.9.7.8)

OTC cards now touch with shared borders, smaller padding, and tighter Yes/No
spacing. Blank example rows are removed. The subtle background and narrow-screen
stacking remain. Both 26.9.7.8 packages are built; installed visual validation
remains pending.

## Medical Authorization content-panel scrolling (26.9.7.7)

Read-only inspection confirmed that the installed student shell scrolls its
`content-main` panel while the document remains stationary. Verified submits now
reset that panel as well as the window after the loading dialog closes. A browser
regression reproduces the inner scrolling panel, fails with the previous code,
and passes with the fix. Both 26.9.7.7 packages are built; installed save validation
remains pending.

## Medical Authorization OTC question styling (26.9.7.6)

Each OTC medication and its Yes/No choices share a lightly shaded card with a thin
border and spacing between questions. Cards stack on narrow screens; unused cells
stay invisible. Styling is scoped to the OTC table and adds no Bootstrap dependency.
Both 26.9.7.6 packages are built; installed visual validation remains pending.

## Medical Authorization OTC consent wording (26.9.7.5)

The requested parent/guardian consent wording appears beneath the OTC heading and
above its radio buttons, with PowerSchool first-name and school-name substitutions.
The dosage sentence is underlined. Duplicated pasted HTML was removed. Both
26.9.7.5 packages are built; installed visual validation remains pending.

## Medical Authorization native Submit styling (26.9.7.4)

The main Submit button inherits PowerSchool's button and disabled styles without
the custom padding, corner radius, or disabled opacity overrides. Both 26.9.7.4
packages are built; installed visual validation remains pending.

## Medical Authorization submit confirmation (26.9.7.3)

Successful Medical Authorization submits scroll to the top after the save is
verified and the loading dialog closes, making the confirmation visible.
Both 26.9.7.3 packages are built; installed validation remains pending.

## Medical Authorization loading and submit binding (26.9.7.2)

The Medical Authorization root is cloaked and hidden until its initial authorization,
prescription, and dose-unit requests settle. PowerSchool's native `loadingDialog()` /
`closeLoading()` pair replaces inline loading messages and also covers saves and
prescription audit retries. The signature section requires a nonblank, non-null name.

Read-only inspection of the installed PowerSchool `ngSubmitDirective` found that its
non-`pssValidationForm` branch returns the original compile function instead of its
compiled link function. The Medical Authorization form consequently had no Angular
submit listener; the native `submitOnce` handler opened a dialog without an API save.
Both health pages now bind their controller submit handler through `health-submit`.
The API form uses PowerSchool's `noSubmitLoading` opt-out, so its own request lifecycle
controls the dialog. Health History retains its native POST and action URL.

AngularJS 1.4.7 tests reproduce the installed decorator and native loading handler,
verify consent/OTC saves, loading-dialog closure after success/failure, initial hiding,
and absent signatures. Both 26.9.7.2 packages are built; installed save validation is pending.

## Medical Authorization empty prescriptions and signature section (26.9.7.1)

The parent/guardian signature and date have their own `box-round` section and
matching blue header. Both remain read-only, and the section appears when a
parent signature exists.

Read-only inspection of the test server confirmed that the prescription PowerQuery
returns only `name` and `@extensions` metadata when no rows exist. This known
successful envelope now becomes an empty list, showing the no-prescriptions message
and enabling Add Medication when authorization data and dose units are loaded.
Malformed responses, login pages, and error envelopes still fail loading.
AngularJS 1.4.7 tests cover an initially empty list, creating its first medication,
audit stamping, and invalid-response rejection. Both 26.9.7.1 packages are built;
installed validation of this revision remains pending.

## Medical Authorization JSON/API loading (26.9.7.0)

Medical Authorization reads the student's existing consent and OTC fields through
`health/data/medicalAuthorization.json`, binds them to `vm.appData`, and saves only
changed fields plus audit metadata through the student-extension schema API.
Blank saved values remain blank; there is no Enrollment Express consent fallback.
Successful saves require a matching read-back. Prescription audit saves use the
same API and preserve pending main-form edits. The existing attribution rules and
read-only parent signature are retained. Health History keeps native submission,
with its shared binding corrected for PowerSchool-generated field names.

AngularJS 1.4.7 browser tests cover JSON loading, saved/blank/false consent, reverted
edits, Boolean versus String serialization, read-back mismatch, load failure,
student isolation, extension creation, and prescription CRUD/audit retries.
Installed Oracle execution, saves, and authorization checks still require testing
after both 26.9.7.0 packages are installed. See `HEALTH_FORMS_MIGRATION.md` for the
separate Basic First Aid response-to-student-field discrepancy found during diagnosis.

## Confirmed completed work

- Version 26.9.5 moves Medical Authorization and Health History into this plugin under
  `/admin/students/health/`, retaining their Health Profile navigation IDs and sort orders.
  Both pages use PowerSchool's AngularJS 1.4.7 loader, native main-form submission,
  model comparison for audit stamps, and scoped Bootstrap-style form controls.
  Prescription CRUD uses independent inline Angular editors and verified audit-only
  requests with retry support. No schemas are moved. Local AngularJS 1.4.7 browser
  tests pass; installed validation is pending. See `HEALTH_FORMS_MIGRATION.md`.
- Version 26.9.6 maps the supplied Health History form 24779195 export, adding
  seizures, inhaler use, allergies, EpiPen, school-specific document notices,
  dental agreement, and sports follow-ups. Parent document-return methods are
  shown as read-only radio buttons beneath the form links and never submitted. The user-approved inhaler-contract condition is
  enrollment-school 311 and inhaler = Yes. Hidden fields retain their values but
  are disabled for POST and excluded from change comparison. Allergies remain a single editable
  native field saved and audited with the main form; there is no allergy table.
  No schemas change. See `HEALTH_HISTORY_RULES.md`.

- A PowerSchool extension XML exists.
- The XML defines:
  - `u_student_medication`, a student child table for medication definitions.
  - `u_student_medication_inventory`, a standalone table for inventory lots.
  - `u_student_med_inv_txn`, a standalone append-only inventory and administration activity table.
  - `u_cdol_health_option`, a shared standalone table for categorized Health workflow options.
- The schema includes medication name, dose, dose unit, inventory unit, frequency, route, audit user/date, notes, and immutable quantities received. Remaining quantities are derived rather than stored.
- The data model direction of one medication to many inventory lots has been established.
- The repository schema defines the append-only `u_student_med_inv_txn` inventory transaction table.
- Existing inventory lots are read-only in the drawer; refills create new lots.
- Parent pickup and other approved removals create one medication-level transaction and display in the Inventory Activity table at the bottom of Edit Inventory.
- Lot balances and total available inventory are derived by applying the net transaction quantity to immutable received lots in FIFO order.
- Added in Error and Wrong Number Entered removals are classified as inventory-entry corrections. They reduce the effective received quantity and displayed denominator FIFO without changing stored lots or transactions, and the low-inventory calculation caps its replenishment baseline at that effective quantity. Fully corrected lots are hidden only from the main quantity display; normally depleted lots remain visible, and all original records remain in Edit Inventory and Inventory Activity.
- The medication definition includes an automatically maintained replenishment baseline. Nurses do not configure per-dose inventory quantities or alert percentages.
- The inventory page calculates Normal, Low, Critical, and Out states from fixed 20% and 10% thresholds. Normal has no visible indicator and percentages are not displayed. The full warning label is left-aligned and the quantity is right-aligned on the single inventory row or on the Total row when multiple lots exist; Out of Inventory uses a subtle pale-red treatment. Adding inventory resets the baseline; deductions do not.
- The main page labels creation as `Add Medication`; the edit drawer uses `Add Inventory` for additional count-in rows on an existing medication.
- Add/Edit Medication prevents duplicate definitions for the same student when normalized medication name, numeric dosage amount, and dose unit match, while allowing the same name with a different dosage or dose unit.
- Medication-name spacing is normalized on blur and before save by trimming the ends, collapsing repeated internal spaces, and capitalizing the first character while preserving the remainder of the entered capitalization.
- Medication dose unit, inventory unit, route, frequency, and removal type dropdowns load Active values from `u_cdol_health_option` categories `MED_DOSE_UNIT`, `MED_INVENTORY_UNIT`, `MED_ROUTE`, `MED_FREQUENCY`, and `MED_REMOVAL_TYPE`. A fresh table remains empty until a district administrator adds or imports values.
- Each dropdown's italicized `Other` action temporarily replaces that dropdown with a text field, plus button, and Cancel button. A successful plus action restores the dropdown with the new value selected; Cancel restores it without creating a value. The plus action trims and normalizes the value, stores the same first-letter-capitalized text as Display Value and Description, and generates a lowercase Code with all whitespace removed. Display Value/Description are limited to 100 characters, Code is limited to 40, duplicates select the existing option, and similar values display the shared advisory reuse warning while the user types.
- Add/Edit Medication accepts only Active values from the four medication-definition option categories. Remove Inventory accepts only an Active `MED_REMOVAL_TYPE` value. The medication fields and removal transactions store stable option codes while the UI resolves their current display labels.
- `/admin/district/healthsetup/cdolhealthoptions.html` provides the district CDOL Health Code Sets manager. It follows the native Code Set pattern with a category selector, conditional Show Inactive checkbox and count immediately before Add Code, Sort Alphabetically and Add Code actions, value table, and edit drawer. The table displays Created By immediately after Display Value and each option's computed usage count immediately after Status, including medication definitions, medication transaction snapshots/removal types, and Health Log references. Administrators can add codes, change display labels, mark values Active or Inactive, reorder the main grid with Move up and Move down buttons, or alphabetize the selected code set. Alphabetical sorting works for every custom health code set and sorts the Active and Inactive groups separately. Inactive values are hidden by default; when shown, they remain below all Active values and reorder only within the Inactive group. The Add drawer warns about similar existing values after ignoring capitalization, punctuation, common filler words, and common destination-action words, while leaving Save available for an intentionally distinct value; exact duplicates remain blocked. The drawer places Display Value, Code, and Active on one aligned row, with the Active checkbox centered below its label, and displays Created By, Created On, Modified By, and Modified On as read-only audit information when editing an existing option. Created On and Modified On use AngularJS date formatting as `MM/dd/yyyy h:mm a`. Display order is assigned automatically and is not typed in the drawer. Codes are immutable after creation and rows are not deleted.
- PowerSchool supplies the shared option table's ID and standard created/modified audit columns. The application does not submit those fields.
- Enhanced Navigation catalogs the manager under **District Management → Health**, after native Health Code Sets, using `districtLevelContext = 2`. The page also displays a District Office-only warning instead of the manager when rendered outside District Office context.
- Inventory quantities use spaced remaining/original formatting such as `2.75 / 5 Pills` for readability.
- Add/edit and removal use one PowerSchool drawer with internal modes so medication context is preserved.
- Reversal is not exposed in the nurse-facing inventory workflow. A future correction workflow must be designed separately from medication physically returning to school.
- The full inventory workflow has been validated successfully on the PowerSchool test server, including medication creation, required inventory, multiple inventory rows, read-only lots, additions, FIFO deductions, insufficient-inventory blocking, decimal quantities, warning thresholds, duplicate prevention, and medication-name normalization.
- The initial student-specific Medication Administration page is implemented as one Administer Medication button followed directly by a simple administration-history table. Inventory is not displayed on the page. The drawer limits medication selection to medications with inventory available and records administered date/time, quantity, staff member, and notes. Routine administrations save directly without a redundant confirmation modal; required-field validation, available-inventory validation, save-in-progress protection, and inline medication details remain in place.
- Version 26.9.3 adds PowerSchool List and Chart tabs to that same page. List remains the default and preserves the
  existing table and controls. Chart is a read-only annual summary that combines all medications, derives its statuses
  from the existing effective administration reducer, and loads school-year session and enrollment classifications from
  `data/administrationCalendar.json` only when the Chart tab is opened. It prints through PowerSchool's built-in print
  action as a one-page US Letter landscape record with medication, staff-initial, and calendar legends. Its medication
  filter appears above the chart title, defaults to All Medications, and can rebuild the chart and legends for one selected
  medication. Medication keys use the first three letters of the medication name, staff initials use italic signature-style
  text, and all legends appear below the calendar. The compact chart header left-aligns a prominent student name, grade,
  and translated gender line. The line is 16 pixels on screen and 8 points in print, retains the same small top gap in both views, and continues with Medication / Dosage and its
  comma-separated list, whose three-letter codes are bold. Month names fit the first column; weekend `W` and no-school
  `NS` markers are enlarged and centered; and `NS` is labeled `No School` in the calendar key. Chart-only print
  preparation mirrors the Emergency Quick Sheet boundary pattern so PowerSchool's header, student banner, page title,
  navigation, tabs, and controls are excluded from the printed record.
  When two administering staff members share first-and-last initials, the chart adds their available middle initials,
  includes their middle names in the staff legend, and gives the readable Lucida Handwriting signature font to staff with fewer entries.
  The matching staff member with the most effective Given entries retains the primary signature font.
  This uses the existing administration response and does not add a page-load request.
- The Administer Medication button remains visible even when no medication is available. In that case, the drawer explains that medication must first be added through the Medication Inventory page. The administration drawer uses compact spacing consistent with the other medication drawers.
- The administration drawer repeats the Inventory page's warning colors in compact status pills. Available Inventory shows the medication's current non-normal status. The Quantity Administered pill recalculates live from the projected inventory remaining after the entered quantity, so it can change from Normal to Low Inventory, Critical Inventory, or Last of Inventory before saving. Last of Inventory uses the Out styling but accurately describes administering the remaining amount. Invalid or excessive quantities do not show a projected pill, the no-available-medication message displays Out of Inventory, and Normal remains unmarked.
- The Inventory and Administration grid toolbars provide matching low-emphasis, left-arrow navigation links while keeping Add Medication and the Administration page's Administer Medication button as the primary actions. Administration links to `← View Medication Inventory`; Inventory links to `← Administer Medication`; and all links preserve the current student's PowerSchool FRN. The no-inventory administration drawer guidance also links directly to that student's inventory.
- When history contains more than one medication definition, the administration table provides a medication filter that distinguishes medication name and prescribed dosage.
- Each given administration is stored as one `ADMINISTRATION` row in the existing inventory transaction ledger. The row contains medication-detail snapshots and its negative quantity is consumed by the same FIFO calculation used for other deductions.
- Administration history includes an Actions column matching the Health Log pattern. The pencil opens an auditable Correct Administration drawer; the minus opens an Entered-in-Error drawer whose Save action requires confirmation. Corrections never PUT or DELETE the original administration.
- The correction drawer uses the same full-width alternating row layout as the administration and inventory drawers. Its summary and date/staff rows are gray, quantity and notes rows are white, and the required correction reason is visually separated in a light-blue section that follows the PowerSchool `feedback-info` color treatment without presenting it as an informational message.
- `ADMINISTRATION_CORRECTION` rows store the corrected administration snapshot and apply only the inventory quantity difference. `ADMINISTRATION_VOID` rows restore the current effective quantity. Both reference the original administration, require a reason, and capture the correction's date, time, and user. History shows one effective row labeled Corrected or Entered in Error, retains the correction audit details, and disables further actions after an entry is marked Entered in Error.
- The final Entered-in-Error confirmation dialog uses padded message content so its warning text and action buttons are not crowded against the dialog edges.
- The Edit Inventory drawer labels its transaction table `Inventory Activity`. It includes administrations, removals, entered-in-error offsets, and quantity-changing corrections, while excluding documentation-only administration corrections whose inventory delta is zero. Correction activity shows the correction date, correcting user, and correction reason. Corrected original administrations use the same compact status pill as Administration history; Entered in Error uses the red warning version.
- Successful routine administrations, corrections, and entered-in-error actions display a PowerSchool `feedback-confirm` message inside the rounded administration table container. It clears automatically after five seconds through a browser timer that explicitly schedules the Angular UI update.
- Health-log and active-staff reads are served by SQL-backed JSON pages in this plugin.
- The application no longer calls the `net.cdolinc.health.healthLog.logs` or `net.cdolinc.health.healthLog.staff` PowerQueries at runtime.
- The internal schema API permission mappings formerly supplied by `cdol_health_log_pqs` are maintained in this repository. Medication custom-page writes do not require external API field access requests.
- The default VS Code build creates two installable plugins from the one repository and source `plugin.xml`: the main plugin without `permissions_root`, and a `CDOL Health - Data Access` plugin containing the permission mappings without `user_schema_root` or application files.
- PowerSchool rejects `/ws/district/codeset` as a target in a plugin permission-mapping file because that file cannot grant access to core-resource routes. Medication and Health Log option reads and additions use the internal schema API for `u_cdol_health_option`. The Health Log page receives only GET and POST access; option maintenance remains on the district manager.
- Shared schema API reads request every 100-record page so imported and newly added options remain visible after the option table exceeds PowerSchool's default first-page limit.
- Medication Administration Settings uses the standard PowerSchool admin page structure with School Setup breadcrumbs, a visible page heading, a rounded cutoff section, and an explicit unconfigured state. The cutoff appears in PowerSchool's two-column settings-table pattern with a bold label and separate value column. The time field uses an `HH:MM AM/PM` placeholder so an example value cannot be mistaken for a saved cutoff, and the controls do not depend on a newly introduced controller property that can be absent when PowerSchool retains an older cached script.
- Version 26.9.4 adds the school-level **Hide Depleted Inventory Batches** setting. It defaults to off. When enabled, the Medication Inventory page hides normally depleted zero-remaining batches and excludes their effective original quantities from the displayed denominator. It does not change stored lots, transaction history, remaining inventory, FIFO deductions, inventory status, or fully corrected-lot behavior.
- New Health Log records use Active options from `HEALTH_COMPLAINT`, `HEALTH_DESTINATION`, and `HEALTH_CONVERSATION`. Complaint and Destination store one code and retain the italicized `Other` workflow. Communication Methods display active options as checkboxes, require at least one choice, and store selected codes comma-separated in `conversation_type`; `+ Add communication method` creates and immediately checks a reusable method. All three inline add controls display the shared advisory reuse warning for similar existing options while the user types. History resolves combined codes to comma-and-space-separated labels. Save remains disabled while any add is open, pending, or failed. Treatment remains free text, Sport continues to use PowerSchool's native `Sports` Code Set, and `HEALTH_SPORT` is not exposed by the custom manager.
- Existing Health Log values are resolved by code or case-insensitive display value without bulk conversion. Active matches show the dropdown or checked communication methods while preserving the original stored value unless a selection is deliberately changed. A communication value is split on commas only when every segment resolves to a known method. Inactive matches and unmatched historical values display read-only and remain unchanged when another field is edited. History falls back to the original text when a value cannot be resolved.
- `docs/u_cdol_health_option_defaults.csv` contains the approved Medication and Health Log import values, including the expanded complaint list and Recess. Conversation Type defaults are Email, Phone, and In Person. `docs/u_cdol_health_option_removal_type_defaults.csv` separately contains the five former hard-coded removal choices with their original stable transaction codes plus `WRONG_NUMBER_ENTERED`. `docs/u_cdol_health_option_not_given_reason_defaults.csv` provides a focused import of Ill, Refused, and Absent for missed-administration testing. The italicized `Other` UI action is not stored.
- Daily medication gap detection is implemented for the controlled `daily` frequency code. It derives expected rows
  from the medication school's year term, `Calendar_Day` in-session flag, weekday, student enrollment, first inventory
  date, and per-school daily cutoff. A missing cutoff displays a configuration warning and suppresses calculated gaps.
- Unresolved gaps appear as red Action Required rows in Administration history. The weekday appears with the date,
  the Status column shows a `Missed` pill, and the Action Required resolution button is in the Actions column. The
  resolution drawer can create a backdated Given transaction or a stored Not Given transaction with a required
  controlled reason. Not Given rows use one `Not Given: reason` status pill while event notes remain in the Notes
  column. Correction-status pills are not repeated in the Medication column. Missed uses the light-red status style,
  Entered in Error uses the stronger dark-red style, and Corrected uses a light-blue feedback-note style across the
  entire row and its status pill.
- `MED_NOT_GIVEN_REASON` is district-managed and uses the same italicized `Other` add-new action as other medication
  code sets. The approved import defaults are Ill, Refused, and Absent; no Student-prefixed values or stored Other
  value are included.
- Not Given rows store stable reason codes and label snapshots. Reason corrections and later conversion to Given are
  append-only, and the Administration page computes the effective state while retaining audit history.

## Attendance-based automatic absence processing (planned)

The user approved next-morning processing after the overnight attendance refresh on September 3, 2026. This process
will be independent of the school's Daily Medication Cutoff Time, and the school settings page must state that
distinction clearly. The existing cutoff-based alerts remain unchanged.

Read-only test-server Data Dictionary inspection confirmed `PS_ATTENDANCE_DAILY.PRESENCE_STATUS_CD` and
`PS_ADAADM_DEFAULTS_ALL` fields for student/date/school, default attendance and conversion modes, `ATTENDANCEVALUE`,
and `POTENTIAL_ATTENDANCEVALUE`. Definitions alone do not validate the percentage calculation, current data freshness,
or query execution. The reporting-view and backing-table descriptions of potential attendance require reconciliation
against sample results.

The scheduled worker, automatic-absence settings controls, and automatic submissions are not implemented. Required
future settings-page wording is recorded in `REQUIREMENTS.md`; remaining decisions and validation gates are in
`OPEN_WORK.md`. No new processing time, external service, or medication write has been configured.

## Administration quantity label (26.8.7.26)

The Administration table passes the effective administered quantity to the
`pluralize` filter. Quantities of 1 or less display the singular unit (`1 Pill`,
`0.5 Pill`, `0.25 Pill`); quantities above 1 retain the existing plural behavior.
This supersedes the 26.8.7.25 rule that only singularized exactly 1. Numeric strings
such as `1.0` and `0.25` are supported; missing or invalid counts keep the legacy behavior.
The default inventory labels Pill, Tablet, Capsule, Milliliters, Milligrams, and
Units also work when their display label is already plural. Custom labels and
abbreviations are preserved for singular quantities rather than guessing their grammar.
Other callers that omit the quantity keep their existing behavior. No stored
records, prescribed dosage labels, missed/not-given dashes, or inventory math change.
Regression coverage: `tests/medication_quantity_label.test.cjs`.

## Resolve drawer time input (26.8.7.24)

Time Given uses PowerSchool's `pss-time-widget` directive and keeps its Given
row mounted with `ng-show`. The legacy class-only input was created after drawer
initialization, so it missed the native widget wrapper, compact width, and clock
padding. Keeping the input mounted alone was insufficient; the native directive
explicitly initializes the widget.

A browser-only template override on the test server confirmed the same 86px
content width and 20px left padding as Administer Medication. Given/Not Given
toggles preserve the typed time and one widget wrapper. No records were saved and
no server files were changed. Time conversion, validation, date, staff, and
inventory logic are unchanged. Template regression checks are in
`tests/test_resolve_time_input.py`; install the package for final acceptance.

## School-level header counter

The school-level header counter is implemented in version 26.8.7.15. It counts
distinct students with unresolved daily administrations using the existing
calendar/cutoff/enrollment and effective transaction rules. It uses the selected
school/year, is absent at District Office, links to the missed daily administration
report at `/admin/reports_pscb_dev_pro/health/cdol_missed_daily_administration.html`, and reuses
Medication Administration modify permission in both the footer and endpoint.
The matching shared badge stylesheet is supplied by CDOL CSS 26.8.0.4, with a
native-height icon container and a circular single-digit badge. Local
SQL-behavior, student-reducer parity, and browser fixture checks pass; live
PowerSchool authorization, Oracle execution, and toolbar integration still need
test-server validation. See `MISSED_MEDICATION_HEADER.md`.
The count now loads once per page, matching Enrollment Express; no timer, focus,
visibility, or back/forward-cache refresh is registered.

## Student missed-medication alert (26.8.7.23)

The new `title_student_end_css.missedmedication.student.alert.txt` extension
renders a single student alert only when its server-side query finds unresolved
daily administrations for the selected student. It follows the Custom Alerts
placement pattern, with a native same-tab link to Administration retaining the
student FRN. No dialog, timer, AJAX request, persisted alert, or new schema is added.
The student icon has a solid blue cap, blue-outlined body, red plus, and overlapping
orange warning triangle with a white exclamation. The triangle is 21% larger than its initial size and
shifted left, with a transparent knockout gap separating it from the bottle. It displays
at 28 by 28 pixels while keeping the bottle's 21-by-28 scale. The original outlined-cap icon is saved as
`icon-missed-medication-outline.svg`; the white header asset is unchanged.
The existing admin-portal and Administration modify-permission gates enclose the
query and markup. School/year filtering matches the student Administration page,
including its District Office student context; the main header stays school-only.
Local SQL/parity tests and small-icon/link browser checks pass. Live PowerSchool
template expansion, security, placement, and query latency still need testing.
See `MISSED_MEDICATION_STUDENT_ALERT.md`.

The SQL row returns the complete FRN as its first/only column, constructed as
`'001' || TO_CHAR(MIN(expected.studentsdcid))`. The row's `~(student_frn)`
placeholder consumes that value positionally; it does not read a session tag.
The former count output could incorrectly create `frn=3` for three missed days.
The href's missing closing quote is also fixed. The local fixture now executes
the actual SQL and substitutes positional values instead of hard-coding an FRN.

## Prior implementation status reported in ChatGPT

The most recent recovered implementation summary stated:

- The medication definition table exists.
- The inventory-lot table exists.
- An inner inventory-lot UI and save workflow was still missing.
- The medication drawer did not yet include the `inventory_unit` input.
- Creating a medication did not yet POST or create the first inventory lot.
- The next implementation step was to add inventory-lot UI/save logic and create the first lot when a medication is created.

## Not confirmed as completed

The available project files do not prove completion of:

- Live PowerSchool installation and validation of the initial Medication Administration page and `ADMINISTRATION` transaction fields
- Live PowerSchool validation of the missed-dose calendar query, school cutoff settings, and Not Given workflows
- Reminder scheduling
- Controlled-medication reconciliation
- Authorization enforcement
- Server-side concurrency protection against simultaneous inventory removals
- Automated tests
- Packaging and installation validation of the new Medication Administration version
